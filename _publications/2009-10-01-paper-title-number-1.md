excerpt: '(Submitted to CRC Press) We explain present encryption techniques and it's drawback . Introducing the concept of Internet of interconnected things with LLN( low-power lossy networks) and how blockchain can stand as the way forward for encryption and communication for IoT devices. Proposing a new way of merkle tree traversal proving to be make blockchain faster and thus more feasible for a distributed ledger and public key encryption system. Finally we discuss mathematical proof of the aforesaid idea with satoshi's approximation , double spend attack , nakamoto's analysis and aysmptotic analysis , providing a c++ code for traversal of merkle root and time complexities of present and proposed functions .'

Abstract: We introduce models for saliency prediction for mobile user interfaces. A mobile interface may include elements like buttons, text, etc. in addition to natural images which enable performing a variety of tasks. Saliency in natural images is a well studied area. However, given the difference in what constitutes a mobile interface, and the usage context of these devices, we postulate that saliency prediction for mobile interface images requires a fresh approach. Mobile interface design involves operating on elements, the building blocks of the interface. We first collected eye-gaze data from mobile devices for free viewing task. Using this data, we develop a novel autoencoder based multi-scale deep learning model that provides saliency prediction at the mobile interface element level. Compared to saliency prediction approaches developed for natural images, we show that our approach performs significantly better on a range of established metrics.
